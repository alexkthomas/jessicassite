My project is a website that is about my girlfriend's writing career and books. Her greatest work so far is her debut novel Stones and Finger Bones. My project links to Amazon where you can buy Stones and finger bones, and some of her other works (check it out!).

The portrait picture on the index.html page links from her current website. The background image on the index.html page links to the Styles.css sheet from (../img/stones_ebook.jpg).

The book cover images on the books.html page link from the (../img/ ) folder as well.

I used 3 different CSS sheets (Normalize, Styles, and Style)so that I could style the 2 pages a little differently.  

Please note the images are not mine. All images are for example only.
