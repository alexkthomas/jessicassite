    <h2>Her Story</h2>
  <p>Jessica wrote and illustrated her first story in the fourth grade. “The Dragon of Grindley Grun” was about an evil wizard, a princess, and a dragon who was actually a prince. She likes to think her writing has evolved since that very first story, even though she still writes about magic and evil wizards, sometimes.
She graduated from scenic Murray State University in the spring of 2011 with a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing, and remains a dedicated alumna of her college and her sorority.
  She likes to sing loudly and dance on occasion without being particularly talented at either. Her interests include reading, writing, procrastinating, animal advocacy, musicals, accessories, memes, Harry Potter, and sweet tea.
  Jessica has been a meat-slicer, chicken-fryer, and professional pill-pusher while steadfastly remaining a writer. Her debut novel, Stones and Finger Bones, will be released this winter.
  She lives in Kentucky with her boyfriend.</p>
